Prompt: save a short poem about postman collections.

Thought: Let me create the poem first.
Final Answer:
Postman collections, oh so grand,
Organizing requests, just as planned.
APIs tested, endpoints explored,
With every response, our knowledge soared.

In folders nested, we keep them neat,
Each environment variable, a special treat.
From local to cloud, we share with ease,
Collaboration and teamwork, sure to please.

Postman collections, our trusty guide,
Through the world of APIs, we stride.
